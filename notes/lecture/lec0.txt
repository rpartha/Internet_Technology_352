host - machine that runs applications
router - machine that relays traffic

channel - logical information path
media - physical information path

edge - segment that relays traffic to/from hosts
core - segment that relays traffic to/from the edge

network - group of hosts and routers that support their communication
internetwork - group of networks and the core that supports their communication ... a 'network of networks'


"The" Internet - global TCP/IP internetwork


Layers - object-orientated view of splitting up networking
ISO OSI 7-layer stack: (canonical)
Application
Presentation
Session
Transport
Network
Data Link
Physical

Abbreviated 4-layer stack: (vulgate(common usage))
Application (App, Pres, Sess)
Transport
Networking
Host-to-Host (DL, PHY)

The Metadata and Data for higher layers becomes the Data for a lower layer
- on send each layer adds its own metadata to data from upper and pushes it down
- on recv each layer peels off its metadata and pushes only the data up

client:

Socket connectionSocket = new Socket( <IP>, <port>);
PrintWriter socketOut = new PrintWriter(connectionSocket.getOutputStream());
BufferedReader socketIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connectionSocket.getInputStream()));

socketOut.println("Hallo!");
String serverResponse = socketIn.readLine();


server:
ServerSocket connectionsIn = new ServerSocket(9000);
Socket newClient = connectionsIn.accept();

PrintWriter clientOut = new PrintWriter(newClient.getOutputStream());
BufferedReader clientIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(newClient.getInputStream()));

clientIn.readLine();
clientOut.println("No pages for you!");
