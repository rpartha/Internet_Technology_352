Networks:
what will the delay be (i.e. bandwidth) to send X?

Node -----> Node++

Node Delay = Proc(Protocl) + Queueing + Trans + Prop
(Network-layer analysis)

Circuit/Packet
Circuit:
	- set up circuit (C == circuit set up time)
	- time to send all data (no overhead(!))  (M == message size, B == bandwidth)

	C + M/B

Packet:
	- how much header? (h == header size)
	- how big is the packet? (p == packet data)
	- how many packets for a given message? (i.e. how many headers for a given message)
	- how many times do I have to pay for header? (S == intermediate STA)

((p+h)/B)  * ( ceil(M/p)+S )

*for message - use above but set p == M
