Network:
NodalDelay =
+ProcessingDelay:		delay in computing on protcol (checksum, figure out who to relay to, etc...)
+QueuingDelay:				delay in sending data out (wait because media is busy)
+TransmissionDelay		delay in getting data on to the medium (because it is not instantaneous)
+PropagationDelay		delay in information to propagate through the medium (negligable ... or really not)


Transport:
Circuit
C: connection setup time (seconds)
M: message size (bits)
B: bandwidth (bits/second)

C + M/B


Packet
M: message size (bits)
B: bandwidth (bits/second)
h: header size
d: packet data size (payload)
S: stations(hops)

		((h+d)/B)  *  (ceil(M/d) +S  )



*Message
M: message size (bits)
B: bandwidth (bits/second)
h: header size
d: packet data size (payload)
S: stations(hops)

		((h+M)/B)  *  (1 + S)

Go Back N:
high upstream traffic
minimal work on sender

Selective Repeat:
high downstream traffic
more work on sender

SeqNum:
need to identify each packet
- but -
need to be unique to guard against ambiguity
